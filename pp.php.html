<p>This Privacy Policy is a part of our End-User License Agreement and Terms of Service Agreements, and by participating in any portion of the service you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities conducted within our services.

<p>This information may be used to identify rightful possession of an account in the event of a lost or stolen password. This information may be used to identify multiple accounts as falling under the possession of one individual. This information may be used to prevent those in possession of terminated accounts future access to the service. This information may be used to provide optional email updates from either our website or forums, at the sole discretion of you, the user. This information may be used to verify the status of a donation made to Pokemon World Online.</p>
<p>In the highly unlikely event that legal authorities request Pokemon World Online provide such Personal Information for use in any legal context, Pokémon World Online will be required to oblige the requests of such authorities.</p>
<p>This information may not and will not be shared with any third party source, with the exception of law enforcement officials as previously noted.
